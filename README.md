# Distributed Transaction Processing using PBFT

## Overview
This project implements a **Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)** consensus algorithm to enable reliable distributed transaction processing. PBFT ensures system correctness and availability even when some nodes behave maliciously or fail.

---

## Features
- **Robust consensus:** Tolerates Byzantine faults in distributed nodes  
- **Transaction processing:** Handles distributed transaction requests with fault tolerance  
- **Logging:** Detailed logs for debugging and audit trails  
- **Test cases:** Includes example testcases for evaluation and validation  

---

## Technologies
- Language: Go  
- Modules: `go.mod` and `go.sum` for dependency management  
- Tools: Standard Go tools for building and testing
